# Tips-on-Python-and-sklearn

This repository captures knowledge I have found interesting and that has helped me over the past years. It is intended for my own personal use, where I can come back and find solutions to problems I have already solved. However, if you find this useful, then this repository is achieving more than it was built for.

## Sklearn pipelines

* Add table with tips

## Feature preprocessing 
*(for classification and regression problems)*

Ideas:
* (1) Majority class accuracy, sampling algos (SMOTE, other), weighting classes, weighting errors
* (2) One-hot (or other encoding techniques), for high cardinality take top X% volume and the rest categorise as 'Other'
